## Environment Variables to Set on Render

Before deploying, make sure these are set in Render.com dashboard:

```
BOT_TOKEN=6889252954:AAFhlE_vn5i6HC62LXqmKhygnm24_ihqusU
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://areno:iaITMVkeyDjbs2RwkaHMJhaKxSde6ZAp@dpg-d3089fvdiees73eqk9o0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com/microservices_wo39
RAILWAY_URL=https://dealbot.onrender.com
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Deploy Now!

### Option 1: Git Push (Automatic Deployment)

```cmd
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically detect the push and start building.

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your service "dealbot-webapp"
3. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"

## Post-Deployment Testing

After deployment completes (5-10 minutes):

1. **Check Health**
   ```
   curl https://dealbot.onrender.com/
   curl https://dealbot.onrender.com/health
   ```

2. **Test Webapp**
   Visit: https://dealbot.onrender.com/webapp/

3. **Test Bot**
   Send a message to your Telegram bot

4. **Check Logs**
   - In Render dashboard, click "Logs" tab
   - Look for "Application ready for production deployment"

## Known Build Warning (Safe to Ignore)

You might see this at the end of the build:
```
[vite:build-import-analysis] Parse error @:1:1
file: C:/Users/rikrd/source/repos/NEWBOT/webapp/src/services/api/httpClient.ts
```

**This is safe to ignore!** The build completes successfully and all files are generated. This is a post-build analysis warning that doesn't affect functionality.

## Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong, check `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps.
