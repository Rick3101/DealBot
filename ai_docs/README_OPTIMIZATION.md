**Step 3:** Test improvement
```bash
curl -H "X-Chat-ID: 5094426438" http://localhost:5000/api/expeditions/7
```

**Step 4:** If still slow, use full guide
- Follow `backend_endpoint_optimization_guide.md`
- Implement Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3

## 🎯 Current Issue Summary

### Problem
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/expeditions/<int:expedition_id>`
- **Status:** ❌ Timing out (>10 seconds)
- **Expected:** <500ms response time

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Data model mismatch** - API expects fields not in `ExpeditionResponse`
2. **Missing data** - Consumptions not fetched
3. **Multiple queries** - N+1 query problem
4. **No optimization** - No caching, no indexes

### Frontend Impact
- ExpeditionDetails page can't load data
- Users see timeout errors
- Real-time updates don't work

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Metric | Current | Quick Fix | Full Optimization |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Response Time | >10s | <500ms | <200ms |
| Database Queries | 10-20+ | 3-5 | 1-2 |
| Cache Hit Rate | 0% | 0% | 80%+ |
| Concurrent Users | <5 | 20+ | 100+ |

## 🧪 Testing Scripts

### Quick Performance Test
```python
import time
import requests

start = time.time()
response = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:5000/api/expeditions/7',
    headers={'X-Chat-ID': '5094426438'}
)
duration = time.time() - start

print(f"Response time: {duration:.3f}s")
print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")

if duration < 0.5:
    print("✅ PASS: Response time OK")
else:
    print(f"❌ FAIL: Response time too slow ({duration:.3f}s)")
```

### Diagnostic Tool
```bash
python diagnose_endpoint.py
```

### Load Test
```bash
# Install Apache Bench (ab)
# Then run:
ab -n 100 -c 10 \
   -H "X-Chat-ID: 5094426438" \
   http://localhost:5000/api/expeditions/7
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

### How to Know It's Fixed

**✅ Response Time**
```bash
# Should complete in <500ms
time curl -H "X-Chat-ID: 5094426438" http://localhost:5000/api/expeditions/7
```

**✅ All Data Present**
```bash
# Should have all required fields
curl ... | jq 'keys'
# Expected: ["completed_at", "consumptions", "created_at", "deadline", "id", "items", "name", "owner_chat_id", "progress", "status"]
```

**✅ Frontend Works**
- Open `http://localhost:3000/webapp/`
- Navigate to an expedition
- Page loads without timeout
- All data displays correctly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still Timing Out After Quick Fix?

1. **Check database connection:**
```python
from database.connection import get_db_manager
db = get_db_manager()
print(db.health_check())
```

2. **Check for data issues:**
```sql
-- How many consumptions?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM item_consumptions WHERE expedition_id = 7;

-- If >1000, add pagination
```

3. **Add indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_item_consumptions_expedition_id ON item_consumptions(expedition_id);
```

4. **Enable query logging:**
```python
# Add to expedition_service.py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Database Query Taking Too Long?

See `endpoint_performance_diagnostic.md` for:
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE usage
- Index recommendations
- Query optimization techniques

### Python Code Slow?

Use cProfile:
```python
import cProfile
cProfile.run('expedition_service.get_expedition_response(7)')
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

### What We Discovered

1. **Data Model Mismatch**
   - API endpoint expected different fields than model provided
   - Always validate API contracts match data models

2. **N+1 Query Problem**
   - Getting items then looping to get details
   - Solution: Use JOINs to fetch related data

3. **Missing Consumptions**
   - Frontend needs consumption data
   - Backend wasn't fetching it

4. **No Performance Testing**
   - Issue wasn't caught until production
   - Need automated performance tests

### Best Practices Going Forward

✅ **Always use JOINs** instead of multiple queries
✅ **Add indexes** on foreign keys
✅ **Cache expensive operations** with TTL
✅ **Test with realistic data** (100+ items)
✅ **Monitor performance** in production
✅ **Set response time budgets** (<500ms)
