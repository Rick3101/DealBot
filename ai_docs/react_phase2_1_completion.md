  - Composed hooks for list, CRUD, dashboard, auto-refresh, real-time
  - Maintained identical API surface
  - Added clear hook composition comments

---

## Architecture Improvements

### Before (Monolithic Hook)
```typescript
// 269 lines handling:
// - List fetching
// - CRUD operations
// - Dashboard data
// - Auto-refresh
// - WebSocket events
// All in one file!
```

### After (Composed Hooks)
```typescript
// useExpeditions.ts (206 lines)
const listHook = useExpeditionsList()      // List management
const crudHook = useExpeditionCRUD()       // CRUD operations
const dashboardHook = useDashboardData()   // Dashboard data
useAutoRefresh()                           // Auto-refresh
useExpeditionRealTime()                    // Real-time updates

// Each hook is independently usable!
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each hook has one clear purpose
2. **Reusability**: `useAutoRefresh` can be used anywhere for interval-based updates
3. **Testability**: Isolated logic with focused test suites (43 new tests)
4. **Maintainability**: Smaller files (48-118 lines vs 269 lines)
5. **Composability**: Main hook cleanly orchestrates focused hooks
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces

## Test Results

### Test Execution Summary
```
Test Files:  10 passed (10)
Tests:       156 passed (156)
  - Phase 0:     113 tests
  - Phase 2.1:   43 new tests
Duration:    4.45s
Pass Rate:   100%
```

### Test Coverage by Hook

| Hook | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------|
| useExpeditionsList | 8 | All states, success/error, manual updates |
| useExpeditionCRUD | 9 | All operations, callbacks, error handling |
| useDashboardData | 8 | Timeline/analytics, loading, errors |
| useAutoRefresh | 8 | Intervals, enable/disable, cleanup |
| useExpeditionRealTime | 10 | Events, subscriptions, callbacks |
| **Total** | **43** | **Comprehensive** |

### Test Quality

- ✅ All hooks tested in isolation
- ✅ Success and error paths covered
- ✅ Callback behavior validated
- ✅ State transitions verified
- ✅ Cleanup and unmounting tested
- ✅ Edge cases handled (missing callbacks, dynamic changes)

---

## Performance Improvements

### Dependency Array Fixes (from QW-2)
- Fixed incorrect dependencies causing unnecessary re-renders
- Improved hook composition efficiency
- Better memoization in composed structure

### Separation of Concerns
- List fetching independent from dashboard data
- CRUD operations isolated from fetching
- Auto-refresh reusable for any component
- Real-time updates cleanly separated

---

## Backward Compatibility

### API Surface (100% Compatible)
```typescript
// Before & After - IDENTICAL API
const {
  expeditions,
  timelineData,
  analytics,
  loading,
  error,
  refreshing,
  refreshExpeditions,
  createExpedition,
  updateExpeditionStatus,
  deleteExpedition,
  refreshTimeline,
  refreshAnalytics,
} = useExpeditions(options);
```

### Breaking Changes
**Zero** - All existing consumers continue to work unchanged

---

## Code Quality Metrics

### File Size Reduction
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Main hook lines | 269 | 206 | -23% |
| Largest file | 269 | 118 | -56% |
| Average file size | 269 | 81 | -70% |
| Total lines (including tests) | 269 | 909 | +238% (due to 5 new hooks + tests) |

### Complexity Reduction
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Reduced per-file complexity by splitting concerns
- **Code Duplication**: Zero (each hook is unique)
- **Testability**: Dramatically improved (43 focused tests vs 0 before)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Pattern Proven**: Hook composition pattern works excellently
2. **Test-First Mindset**: Tests caught async timing issues early
3. **Clear Separation**: Each hook's responsibility was obvious
4. **Reusability Achieved**: `useAutoRefresh` is genuinely generic

### Challenges Faced
1. **Test Timing**: React Testing Library async state updates required `waitFor`
2. **Timer Management**: `useAutoRefresh` tests needed `vi.useFakeTimers()`
3. **WebSocket Mocking**: Event subscription testing required capturing handlers

### Solutions Applied
1. Used `waitFor` consistently for state assertions
2. Proper timer mocking with fake timers in tests
3. Captured handlers in mocks to simulate event firing

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **React Query Migration**: Could replace with `useQuery` and `useMutation`
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Add to CRUD hook for better UX
3. **Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff to list fetching
4. **Cache Integration**: Connect to Phase 3 caching layer

### Not Recommended
- Further splitting of hooks (would create too much granularity)
- Combining hooks back together (defeats the purpose)

---

## Conclusion

Phase 2.1 successfully refactored the `useExpeditions` hook into a clean, composable architecture while maintaining 100% backward compatibility. The 86% efficiency gain (2.5h vs 18h) demonstrates the power of:

1. **Proven patterns** from Phase 1
2. **Clear separation of concerns**
3. **Comprehensive testing** (43 new tests)
4. **Type-safe interfaces**

All 156 tests pass, zero breaking changes occurred, and the codebase is significantly more maintainable. Ready to proceed with Phase 2.2 (Complete API Service Layer Split).

---

**Next Phase**: Phase 2.2 - Complete remaining API service domain splits
**Estimated**: 14 hours
**Expected (based on efficiency)**: ~3-4 hours
