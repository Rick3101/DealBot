## 6. Integration Specifications

### 6.1 Sales System Integration

#### Automatic Sale Creation
- **Trigger**: When consumption is assigned
- **Data**: Use anonymized pirate names for buyer field
- **Process**: Create sale record with expedition_id reference
- **Inventory**: Maintain FIFO consumption pattern

#### Sale Record Structure
```python
CreateSaleRequest(
    comprador=pirate_name,  # Anonymized name
    items=[CreateSaleItemRequest(
        produto_id=product_id,
        quantidade=assigned_quantity,
        valor_unitario=actual_unit_price
    )],
    expedition_id=expedition_id  # Link back to expedition
)
```

### 6.2 Payment System Integration

#### Debt Tracking
- **Integration Point**: Use existing payment/debt system
- **Anonymization**: Track debts using pirate names
- **Reconciliation**: Link expedition payments to sale payments
- **Reporting**: Maintain debt visibility for owner

#### Payment Flow
```python
# When expedition payment is recorded
payment_request = CreatePaymentRequest(
    venda_id=assignment.sale_id,
    valor_pago=payment_amount,
    expedition_assignment_id=assignment_id  # New field
)
```

### 6.3 Inventory Integration

#### Stock Management
- **Consumption Timing**: When assignment is executed (not when expedition created)
- **FIFO Maintenance**: Preserve existing FIFO stock consumption
- **Validation**: Check stock availability before assignment
- **Updates**: Real-time inventory updates

#### Key Structure
```python
# Owner key for pirate name decryption
owner_key = generate_owner_key(expedition_id, owner_chat_id)

# Product encryption key for product alias decryption
product_key = generate_product_key(expedition_id, owner_chat_id)

# Combined access for full expedition decryption
full_access_key = combine_keys(owner_key, product_key)
```

### 7.2 Permission Model

#### Access Control Matrix
```
Permission Level | Create | Manage | View | Decrypt
Owner           | ✓      | ✓      | ✓    | ✓
Admin           | ✗      | ✗      | ✗    | ✗
User            | ✗      | ✗      | ✗    | ✗
```

#### Validation Points
- **Handler Level**: Permission decorator on all handlers
- **Service Level**: Owner validation in all methods
- **Database Level**: Owner_chat_id validation in queries
