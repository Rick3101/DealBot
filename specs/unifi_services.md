# Service Unification Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the roadmap for unifying common patterns across the service layer to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and enhance consistency.

## Current State Analysis
- **15 services** analyzed across the application
- **~300-400 lines** of duplicated CRUD operations identified
- **Common patterns** found in validation, database operations, and financial calculations
- **BaseService** already provides foundation with query execution and error handling

## Unification Goals
- Reduce code duplication by 60-70%
- Standardize CRUD operations across all services
- Centralize validation logic
- Improve test coverage through shared components
- Maintain existing interface compatibility

## Phase 1: Foundation Layer (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Base Repository Pattern Implementation
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Estimated Time: 3-5 days**

#### Create `services/base_repository.py`
```python
class BaseRepository(BaseService):
    """Generic repository for common CRUD operations"""

    def __init__(self, table_name: str, model_class, primary_key: str = "id"):
        super().__init__()
        self.table_name = table_name
        self.model_class = model_class
        self.primary_key = primary_key

    # Generic methods to implement:
    # - get_by_id()
    # - get_all()
    # - exists()
    # - create()
    # - update()
    # - delete()
    # - get_by_field()
```
